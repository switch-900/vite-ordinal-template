Bitmap Nexus Builder 
Work in progress 

a `Vite` + `React` + `TailwindCSS` + `R3F` + `Composer Suite` workflow for making ordinal inscriptions, which are apps inlined into a single HTML file, using recursive endpoints like `/content/` and `/r/blockinfo` from ord servers (https://github.com/ordinals/ord)


## local development

clone repo from `https://github.com/ordengine/vite-ordinal-template.git`

1. install

   `npm install`
   or
   `yarn install`

2. run

   `npm run dev`
   or
   `yarn dev`

## build inscription

`npm run build`
or
`yarn build`

your app will be fully bundled into a single HTML file inside the `build` folder

test here: https://ordinals.com/inscription/33633842


## using existing inscriptions recursively

add  the content url to the `inscriptions` section in `package.json`:

then import via alias name
`import {GridFloor} from 'GridFloor'`
